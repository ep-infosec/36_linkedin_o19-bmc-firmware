# This recipe overrides lm_sensors such that sensord is not compiled.
# Sensord depends on rrdtool, gobject-introspection, libxml2, etc. and also tries
# to pull in lighttpd.

# gobject-introspection is failing building with python3.5, and libxml2 has problems
# as well. Until these problems are solved, we compile without sensord in order to
# save 3.5MB+ by excluding python2 and ?KB+ excluding sensord and its dependencies.
