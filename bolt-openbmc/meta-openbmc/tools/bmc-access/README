BMC Access scripts

Installation:
  Copy all the scripts to some directory in the current users path.
  I generally have a 'bin' directory in my home directory and have 
  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
  in my .bashrc.

Logging into the BMC
  bmc shell [OPTIONS]
  OPTIONS:
    -v|--verbose
      Print verbose information
    -b [BMC_IP BMC_PASSWORD] [BMC_DEVICE]
      BMC IP: IPv4/IPv6 IP of the BMC. This assumes that the BMC has the default ssh password.
      BMC PASSWORD: SSH password for the BMC.
      BMC DEVICE: Index provided by bmc devices (See bmc devices & bmc add-device)
    -p|--proxy [PROXY SSH USER/IP] [PROXY SSH PASSWORD]
      PROXY SSH USER/IP is of the form user@proxy_ip
      PROXY SSH PASSWORD is the password of the proxy

    If the BMC IP is not provided, this will log into the last used BMC.
    Most of the time if you reuse the BMCs (as I do) then you just need to call `bmc shell`

Sending files to BMC
  bmc send [OPTIONS] SRC_FILE DEST_PATH
  OPTIONS:
    -v|--verbose
      Print verbose information
    -b [BMC_IP BMC_PASSWORD] [BMC_DEVICE]
      BMC IP: IPv4/IPv6 IP of the BMC. This assumes that the BMC has the default ssh password.
      BMC PASSWORD: SSH password for the BMC.
      BMC DEVICE: Index provided by bmc devices (See bmc devices & bmc add-device)
    -p|--proxy [PROXY SSH USER/IP] [PROXY SSH PASSWORD]
      PROXY SSH USER/IP is of the form user@proxy_ip
      PROXY SSH PASSWORD is the password of the proxy

    If the BMC IP is not provided, this will send the file into the last used BMC.
    Most of the time if you reuse the BMCs (as I do) then you just need to call `bmc send src/blah dest/blah`

Flashing an image to the BMC
  bmc flash [OPTIONS] FLASH_IMAGE
  OPTIONS:
    -v|--verbose
      Print verbose information
    -b [BMC_IP BMC_PASSWORD] [BMC_DEVICE]
      BMC IP: IPv4/IPv6 IP of the BMC. This assumes that the BMC has the default ssh password.
      BMC PASSWORD: SSH password for the BMC.
      BMC DEVICE: Index provided by bmc devices (See bmc devices & bmc add-device)
    -p|--proxy [PROXY SSH USER/IP] [PROXY SSH PASSWORD]
      PROXY SSH USER/IP is of the form user@proxy_ip
      PROXY SSH PASSWORD is the password of the proxy
    -f|--fru FRU
      FRU: Is the FRU name of the BMC. (Default FRU is 'mb' can be changed in bmc-flash `FRU`)
    -c|--components [COMPONENTS LIST]
      COMPONENTS LIST: comma separated list of components. For example, if running:
      bmc flash -f mb -c rom,bmc <flash image>
      this will call 
      fw-util mb --update --rom <flash image>
      fw-util mb --update --bmc <flash image>
    --noreboot
      By default, the tool will reboot the BMC after the update. This will allow us to 
      change that default.

    If the BMC IP is not provided, this will flash the last used BMC.
    Most of the time if you reuse the BMCs (as I do) then you just need to call `bmc flash FLASH_IMAGE`

    TODO: This assumes that the target BMC uses fw-util. We might want to add an option for 'legacy'. Probably
    a 'bmc flashcp' which uses /mtd/<components>.

Remember a device
bmc add-device bmc-ip bmc-password [proxy proxy-password]
  This will store the device for ease access. 
  Note this is stored in clear-text in ~/.bmc_devices. If the password is sensitive, don't do this.
  This allows you to call bmc shell -b 0 For example instead of typing all the information.

Listing remembered devices
bmc devices
  This will display all the remembered devices
devvm ~ $ bmc devices
[0] 172.23.97.166 *default*
[1] 172.23.97.165 (down)

Note, we will attempt at getting the current status of the BMC by pinging it. If it fails, this prints (down) next
to the IP. It will also show *default* next to the last used IP. It does not have to be the first.

Displaying the history
bmc history
  Shows all the operations performed in the past. In case you want to recollect the IP of the BMC last used.
