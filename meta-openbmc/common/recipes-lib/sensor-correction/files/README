Sensor correction
-----------------

This library provides a generic functionality for correcting sensor readings at runtime.
The design uses JSON configuration read at runtime to easy dynamic manipulation and removes
the requirement of releasing a new image just to include a correction.

This is any character string which can be used for display/debugging purposes.

Name: The name of the sensor. Currently only for ease of readability of the JSON.
fru: The fru on which this sensor is present.
id: The ID of this sensor.
correction: The correction information.
  type: The type of correction. Supported types ("conditional_table" - Choose a correction table based on a condition).
  tables: List of tables. Each table is given a name "I0" to ease understandability of the table.
  A table is itself an array of tuples. Each tuple is <cond_value:correction>. Hence new_value = value - correction with correction chosen based on the current value of 'cond_value'
  condition: The condition which dictates which table is chosen for the correction.
  key: The which dictates which table is used.
  default_table: The default table used when either getting the value for the given key fails or if the value is not in the below 'value_map' list.
  value_map: A set of values for 'key' and the name of the corresponding table to be used.
